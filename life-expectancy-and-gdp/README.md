# 📊 Exploring the Relationship Between GDP and Life Expectancy (2000–2015) - using data visualization and Python.

## 📁 Project Overview
This project will explore whether there is a significant correlation between a country's economic output and the life expectancy of its population.

The objectives include preparing the data, conducting an analysis using visualizations, and interpreting the results of the study.

This project aims to address the following key questions:

    * Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
    * Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
    * Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
    * What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
    * What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
